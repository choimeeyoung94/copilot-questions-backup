# copilot: gemini release news online website

### 질문 (Question)

gemini release news online website

machine learning news online website 200 2025

### 답변 (Answer)

Here are official websites that list the latest Google Gemini release news and updates:

Google Gemini Latest News hub: https://gemini.google/latest-news/?hl=en
Google Blog – Gemini news (including monthly "Gemini Drops"): https://blog.google/products/gemini/
Latest "Gemini Drops" post (example): https://blog.google/products/gemini/gemini-drop-september-2025/
Google Workspace Updates (recent releases impacting Gemini features in Workspace): https://support.google.com/a/table/7314896?hl=en
Tip: The Gemini "Latest News" hub and the Google Blog's Gemini section are the best starting points for broad updates, while Workspace Updates is ideal for admin/enterprise rollouts.

Do you want a list of exactly 200 online websites for machine learning news in 2025? A few quick clarifications so I can tailor it:

Scope: Pure machine learning only, or broader AI (LLMs, robotics, data science) as well?
Types to include: Newsrooms/mags, research org blogs (e.g., DeepMind, OpenAI), company AI blogs (NVIDIA, Meta), academic publishers, aggregators, or only news sites?
Language/region: Global/English-only, or include non-English?
Format: CSV (name, URL, focus, type, paywall, notes) or Markdown list?
If you confirm, I can compile the full 200-site list. Would you like me to start with a smaller sample (e.g., top 25) to confirm the direction?
